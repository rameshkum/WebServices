  Example without any framework
  =============================== 


 a)JAX-WS – SOAP handler in server side

  In this article, we show you how to create a SOAP handler and attach it in server side, 
   to retrieve the mac address in SOAP header block from every incoming SOAP message. And do validation to 
   allow only computer with MAC address “90-4C-E5-44-B9-8F” to access this published service.

 b)JAX-WS – SOAP handler in client side

    In this article, you will develop a web service client to access the published service in previous article, 
   and attach a handler to inject client’s MAC address into header block, for every outgoing SOAP message that’s 
   send by client side.
